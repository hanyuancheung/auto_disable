# auto_disable
A tool focus on inner servers' auto disable

This repo is a inner tool made by myself when I'm at agora, which is used to focus on the quality and resource least, in order to auto disable our server clusters.

Based  on the requirements, UAP have about thousands of servers all around the world, and real time network is one of the most important part of our company. According to that, we have to report the real time quality to our SRE or administors, so I dev this tool to do that. Apart from that, we give the data from our database to company weixin version, cause weixin have some APIs to do the job.
